<desc>Upgrade events.</desc>
<changelog>You can now upgrade weapons in special events. Upgraded weapon uses 1 less power and charges faster (1 sec charge time difference, with exception of charge and chain weapons).
Weapons that cost 1 power cannot be upgraded.
Missiles cannot be upgraded as all missiles available to players are already upgraded. Enemies use unupgraded missiles.</changelog>
