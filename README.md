# viable-weapons
A mod for FTL: Faster Than Light which rebalances weapons, adds new types, and removes some old ones.

Goals of the mod:
All weapons in the game have to be viable;
There are no clearly overpowered weapons;
Enemies need to have enough projectiles to hurt the player, even in early game, but fewer missiles than in vanilla as they're difficult to deal with;
Make it as easy as possible to get used to the mod while keeping things refreshing and fun.
