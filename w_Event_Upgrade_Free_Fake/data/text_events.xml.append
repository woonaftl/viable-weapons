<text name="W_UPGRADE_FREE_FAKE_TEXT_0">You arrived at the huge station captured by pirates. The pirates did not attack you immediately but offered to upgrade any of your weapons instead. For free.

Tip: Upgraded weapons require 1 less power and charge faster, than stock weapons. Upgraded weapons and weapons that cost 1 power cannot be upgraded.</text>
<text name="W_UPGRADE_FREE_FAKE_TEXT_1">Leave.</text>
<text name="W_UPGRADE_FREE_FAKE_TEXT_2">The pirates have taken your weapon to their station to install necessary modifications.</text>
<text name="W_UPGRADE_FREE_FAKE_TEXT_3">Your weapon did not return to your ship. The station does not respond to your demands to give the weapon back.</text>
<text name="W_UPGRADE_FREE_FAKE_TEXT_4">After hours of working on your weapon, the pirates bring it back. As you open the casing, you realize that it's the different weapon. The delivery workers are long gone and the station does not respond.</text>
